- How do I expand contractions? (i.e. What's -> What is)
- I should probably:
1. Tokenize
2. Expand contractions
3. Eliminate punctuation par #
4. Lowercase all?
- nltk vs spacy? -> gonna go w/ nltk

- Should I use tensorflow_dataset tools?
- Created tensorflow_RNN to test the above (so I don't overwrite what I have)
- HUGE PROBLEM: How do I set aside sub datasets for training and evaluating?
    1. train_test_split for test, train, val then load into tf.Dataset?
    2. load into tf.Dataset, then split that Dataset?
    Decided to go with 1, par val (so jus test and train)
- ANOTHER HUGE PROBLEM: Need corpus and vocab to actually decode, might just go back to disaster.py
- Had to nltk.download: stopwords, wordnet
- for now, will not normalize text (i.e. dates, numbers, abbreviations -> text)
- probably will need to replace nltk lemmatization w/ spacy, but nltk good for now
